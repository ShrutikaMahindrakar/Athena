Constraint type Description Example of physical uses Point limit Limits the robot end effector to a particular point A set of point limits can be superimposed to create a 3D path Cuboid Constraint Restricts the robot to motion within a cuboid- shaped region Used to define the robot s workspace Plane Constraint Prevent the robot from penetrating a plane A combination of planes can be generated to recreate a particular environment Cylindrical Constraint Confines the robot to a cylindrical region Linear combination with point limit to give hard and soft constraint for motion along a path Spherical Constraint Defines a critical spherical region Limiting the robot s functional space to a 3D curved surface S.
