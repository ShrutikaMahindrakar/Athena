We then enlisted a group of 60 male patients who had been referred to a urologist due to low urine flow rate and suspected bladder outlet obstruction associated with prostatic enlargement. The patients were asked to record the maximum wavelength whilst voiding into a clinical urine flow meter. The flow meter used was a Smartflow (Albyn Medical).
