The aforementioned practical limits on the range-of- movement for the robotic framework (an approximate sphere (S) of 120mm diameter), and the consequence of having to reposition the support structure to enable access to as much of the length of the vertebral cavity as possible (700mm in length), result in the need to consider how the support structure itself is configured/fits around the patient (Figure 9).
