Instead of the sphere, the struts themselves could be extended as close as practical to the node point, and joined directly to the other adjoining struts, such as by welding or bonding (i.e. gluing). As the struts are subject to compressive forces along their lengths, the ends at the joints have a tendency to push onto the adjacent strut end.
