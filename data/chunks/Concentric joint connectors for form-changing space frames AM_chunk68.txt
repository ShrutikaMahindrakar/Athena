In the prototype joints, the cord cho- sen ( Beta Saltwater Mono 80lb Clear  by Shake- speare Fishing) was a monofilament fishing line of 1.2mm diameter, with a breaking load of 36kg, which also has a sufficient degree of elasticity to al- low the struts to pivot. Testing of the line showed it elongated approx. 1.5mm when supporting a 5kg load.
