Imaging of the Male Urine Stream Imaging of complete voiding events was conducted for a health male volunteer. A scale rule was held alongside and parallel to the urine stream to enable the instantaneous wavelength to be measured from the video images. The temporally varying flow rate was measured using a clinical gravimetric urine flow meter.
