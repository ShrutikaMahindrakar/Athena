Non-malignant spinal tumors can grow to a considerable size, causing damage by putting pressure on the tissue around them [2]. Surgical options for the treatment of spinal tumors vary from complete to partial removal. This may be done by a surgical approach from the front or back of the spine and may involve going through the neck, chest or abdomen.
