Nylon 66 (a type of polyamide) was chosen in prototypes due to its bal- ance between reasonable resistance to bending forc- es, low friction properties and good resistance to impact loading; it was accepted that relatively minor deformations of the nylon tips would add to the joints overall robustness, with only a negligible ef- fect on the joints overall concentricity within the frame.
