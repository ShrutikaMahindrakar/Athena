6(a), helps to identify this subset of patients as those for whom Lmax=Qmax is greater than the 95% confidence limit of 3:52, determined for healthy volunteers [16]. Figure 4. Experimental and computational models show the influence of flow rate and orifice size and geometry on the shape of the jet flow.
