The streamwise z{axis for the jet flow is simply the time (t) axis for the droplet, scaled by the streamwise jet velocity (w): z~t|w  7  Application to physiologically relevant flow Making use of these assumptions, a computational method developed here is solved for the unsteady development of a 2- dimensional  droplet , whose initial shape was determined from the orifice geometry.
