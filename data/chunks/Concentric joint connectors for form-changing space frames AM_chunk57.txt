The cord passes through the barrel, emerging to entwine with other cords. A relatively non-brittle material such as nylon is also suitable as it directly contacts the cord and exerts a pressure upon it, e.g. when the strut is subject to a compressive force, it attempts to push past the other barrels and shear the cord.
