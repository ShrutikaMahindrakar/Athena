However this can be greatly improved by precalibrating for an individual s meatal geometry. This could simply be achieved by requesting the patient to void into a standard urine flow meter to obtain the relationship between Lmax and Qmax. This approach would also provide a non-invasive measurement of an individual s meatal dilation during voiding.
