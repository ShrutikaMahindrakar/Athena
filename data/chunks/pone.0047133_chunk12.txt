Liquid jet flows have received significant attention in the published literature, and there has been a substantial amount of work which has elucidated the surface-tension driven effects which develop in these flows (a thorough review can be found in [9]). Short wavelength capillary instabilities can often lead to break-up of a liquid column [10 12].
