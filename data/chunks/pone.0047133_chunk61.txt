5(c)). Thus during voiding the meatus opens under the flow pressure so that the aspect ratio reduces and cross sectional area increases, thereby influencing the wavelength (L) with an associated reduction in the dilation parameter (L=Q). At the onset of voiding the pressure is sufficient to cause the meatus to rapidly open (Fig.
