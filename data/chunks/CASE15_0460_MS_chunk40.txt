Considering a sphere with radius r and cantered about the origin O, as shown in Fig.6. The polar equations for the sphere are numbered 1-3, and an example of constraints set for spherical region is listed in table 1: B. Trajectory Supervision The trajectory supervision of the robot is achieved by integrating a control loop feedback mechanism.
