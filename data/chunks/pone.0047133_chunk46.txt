The computational and experimental modeling highlight the dependence of wavelength on orifice aspect-ratio ratio (Dmax=Dmin) and cross sectional area (A). Thus variation in orifice size or urethral dilation between individuals or during the course of a single void will influence the flow pattern and the wavelength.
