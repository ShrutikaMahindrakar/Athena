V. HAPTIC CONTROL OF THE DEPTH OF THE WATER JET CUT The active regional constraint would restrict the movement of the tip from entering a predefined geometric region. This method can be used in the controlling the depth of water jet cut by applying the outcomes obtained from the experimental testing of the water jet cutting animal tissue.
