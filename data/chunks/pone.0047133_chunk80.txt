(c) The opening of the urethral orifice during voiding was quantified by the minimum diameter of the meatal ellipse (Dmin) measured from the video images. The size and shape of the orifice is also characterised by the dilation parameter L=Q, such that a reduction in L=Q corresponds to an increase in opening.
