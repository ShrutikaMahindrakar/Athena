Much work has been done comparing the two main robot configurations; in summary, serial manipulators have a larger working envelope in relation to their overall size [10], whereas parallel manipulators offer positional accuracy of the end effector, and smaller mobile mass than serial ones, thus allowing faster and more precise manipulations that are generally more suitable for medical applications.
