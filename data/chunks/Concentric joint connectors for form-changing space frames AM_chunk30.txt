The forces of compression (FC) and tension (FT) acting along the axes of the struts are shown as lines of force (LF). With the angles of separation (AS) be- tween the struts as shown, the lines of force intersect at a convergence point (CP) of the central connec- tion (CC), and the struts are not subject to shear or moment forces.
