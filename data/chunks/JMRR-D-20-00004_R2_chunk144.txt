The platform provides a large amount of rigidity, or stiffness, for a given structural mass, and thus provides significant positional certainty. In this section, the behavior of the platform is demonstrated using Simulink, with SimMechanics to model the mechanical components of the system. Figure 17 shows the complete platform model.
