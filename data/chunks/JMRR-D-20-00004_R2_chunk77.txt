Nylon 66 (a type of polyamide) was chosen in prototypes due to its balance between reasonable resistance to bending forces, low friction properties and good resistance to impact loading; it was accepted that relatively minor deformations of the nylon tips would add to the joint s overall robustness, with only a negligible effect on the joint s overall concentricity within the frame.
