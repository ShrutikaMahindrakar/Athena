The L=Q parameter reflects the orifice dilation, as quantified through the modelling Fig. 5(c), and thus the non-linearity indicates changes in the meatal dilation during the void. Indeed this was confirmed by measuring from the video images, the meatal opening in terms of the minimum diameter of the urine stream at the meatus (Fig.
